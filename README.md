# Video Game Software Platform

Welcome to the Video Game Software Platform, a project aimed at enabling the execution of various video games and providing common basic elements for the development of new games.

## Game: 1943 - Battle of Midway

In this project, the video game "1943: Battle of Midway" is developed. In this game, the player controls a warplane from the United States Air Force. The player's mission is to defeat enemies, controlled by the computer, belonging to the Empire of Japan.

## Game Objectives
- Destroy enemy air force planes.
- Advance through different levels of the game.
- Destroy the flagship of the enemy fleet, Yamato.

## Mission Development
Each mission consists of two phases: an approach phase and an attack on the target. To complete a mission and progress, the player must cause damage to the "Final Boss" in a range of 70% to 100%. A lower percentage requires repeating the mission.

## Aircraft Energy
The player's plane loses energy when:
- Hit by enemy ammunition.
- Collides with another plane.
- Mission time expires.
- Special attacks (lightning and tsunamis) are used.

## Power-Ups and Weapons
The player can upgrade their plane by collecting different types of bonuses, whether power-ups or weapons with limited effect and duration. Collecting the same type of bonus twice increases its power and duration.

## Bomber Controls
The bomber is controlled with the following controls:
- Arrow keys: movement in 8 directions.
- Key X: shoot (varies according to the weapon).
- Key Z: special attacks (Lightning and Tsunami).
- Spacebar: pause (all keys are configurable).

## Special Attacks
The use of special attacks decreases the energy level. Available special attacks include:
- Lightning: destroys all small planes in the aerial combat phase.
- Tsunami: stops the vertical scrolling of the screen and damages ships in the surface combat phase.

## Enemies
Enemies attack in formations of planes and ships of different sizes.

## Final Bosses
Each mission has a designated "Final Boss" to defeat. Some of the final bosses include Tone, Kaga, Ayako, and the flagship Yamato.

## Configuration
The platform includes a configuration screen with customizable options, such as:
- Play in windowed or fullscreen mode.
- Enable/disable sound.
- Aircraft selection.
- Key definition.
- Musical track selection.
- "RESET" button to restore default values.

## Ranking
The game saves obtained scores and displays the top 10 on an interface before starting and after completing the game. Each entry in the ranking contains the score, player name, and date.
